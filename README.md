![BhWh](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/BHmetrics_WHsim/blob/main/BhWh.PNG)
## Introduction

This repository, maintained by HermiTech LLC, contains a Jupyter notebook (`BHmetrics_WHsim.ipynb`) that delves into advanced astrophysical concepts. It includes visualizations and simulations of Kerr Black Holes and Morris-Thorne Wormholes, merging theoretical astrophysics with interactive visualizations.

## Contents

The notebook encompasses several key sections:

1. **Kerr Black Hole Visualization**: Demonstrates the visualization of the event horizon and ergosphere of a Kerr black hole, highlighting the impacts of rotation on the spacetime geometry of black holes.

2. **Morris-Thorne Wormhole Plot**: Offers a visual representation of the Morris-Thorne wormhole, a theoretical concept in spacetime physics, illustrating a traversable wormhole.

3. **Advanced Wormhole Simulator**: Incorporates an interactive simulator using wxPython and VPython, facilitating the exploration of the Morris-Thorne wormhole under various parameters, including effects from exotic matter and spin.

## Requirements

To use this notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python libraries including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `vpython`, and `wxPython` (users should manually install these libraries)
